There are horror movies, and then there are action/adventure movies.  There are movies about space, then there are movies about fantasy worlds.  There are movies about crimes and then there are movies about love.  Now you can also have movies that are made specifically for women, then there are other made for men.  You also have movies that target black people and their culture, the same with hispanics and whites and other cultures.  I usually stick to the drama, crime or suspense and thriller ones.  Those are the ones I am mostly interested in.	Thanks for allowing me to participate. I love going to the movies, but I cannot afford it. So I just stay home and use Netflix or Hulu.  I have more apps too but those are the two ones I use mainly.  I usually stick with drama or crime as my preference.  Have a wonderful day!
