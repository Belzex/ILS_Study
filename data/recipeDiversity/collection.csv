The video is completely different from the written one. In the interest of clarity for the readers, I tried the written one.

It is a very dense batter, not overly sweet and if you are looking for that result then you should like this recipe. The chips will add that extra flavor kick. Baked plain it is rather bland and if you are a chocoholic likely unsatisfying. It is moist, almost fudgey unlike a good many chocolate recipes.

I should have subbed half the oil with butter, changed the baking soda to salt and baking powder, and used buttermilk and 1 tsp of lemon, instead of yogurt, with an additional 1/4 cup of cocoa powder. Baking Soda needs enough acid to activate it, this recipes does not have an adequate amount of acid for 1 full tsp of Baking Soda to actually work correctly which is part of the large open crumb texture and oily feeling. 1/2 tsp of baking soda needs 1 cup of acid, such as vinegar, buttermilk, or yogurt to activate, with 1 tsp of lemon. Baking Powder on the other hand is half Baking Soda, and requires less to activate because it contains tar tar which is a dry acid that activates the sodium bicarbonate as soon as it gets wet, so subbing the baking powder and salt in would have created a lighter, yet richer, less oily result. I try not to change recipes the first time I make them out of fairness to the author. They just were not rich and flavorful at all, it was sad.

But, next time I will make them (I will definitely be using this recipe again) I will add more sugar and more chocolate chips. Since I didn't think this batch was sweet enough and it was too late to go back and add sugar, I made up a coffee glaze and dipped them in that. They turned out wonderful. (Coffee glaze: 2 tbsp coffee from the pot, 1 tbsp milk, 1 cup +little powdered sugar) **I just made them a second time: this time I almost doubled the sugar, added an extra \xbdcup chocolate chips, and made them in mini muffin pans.

A note about mixing that may help: I mixed the dry ingredients together, whisked them to mix.

Now that I've made it, I can see what the issue is -- if you desire muffins that are overflowing and mountainous like the featured photo - this recipe will make 12-18 muffins.  If you do one standard scoop as you'd do for cupcakes, you'll get 18-24 muffins.  My 1.5x recipe ended up making 18 jumbo muffins (equivalent to 36 regular sized), and that was with doing two standard-sized scoops (4 tbsp scoop).\nI also made the following recipe modifications:  I used sour cream instead of yogurt and soured my milk with a bit of lemon juice.  I also put just a bit of espresso powder in with the dry ingredients to accentuate the chocolate flavor.  I didn't put chocolate chips on top, just put them all in the batter, and actually backed off a bit on the chips.  I baked these at 400 for about 5 minutes, then immediately lowered the temperature to 350 for the remaining time.

First, this made 20 regular sized muffins.  Also, many reviewers stated that their chocolate chips sank to bottom of muffin; to resolve this issue dust chocolat chips with 1T flour.  For those who think this is a dry muffin, check your cocoa.  If it's dark or dutch cocoa you should add extra dairy fat (think sour cream) since chocolate, especially dark and dutch, will absorb the fat content in a recipe and dry it out (also the milk should not be skim or low fat).  Also, if you omit the nuts this too will dry out the recipe as nuts add / help maintain moisture.  That being said, I used 1 1/2 cup AP flour and 1/2 cup whole wheat, and 1 T oil plus 1T applesauce.  Since I use a cocoa which is half semi-sweet / half dutch I added 2 t sour cream (double that if your cocoa is not a combo).  My milk was 2%, but whole milk would've been a better option. Also, do not overcook.  I baked 20 minutes and removed IMMEDIATELY from pan to help end residual baking.  My muffins were chocolately and moist.  The family really enjoyed.  Better than store bought.  P.S.

I sprayed the pan and had no sticking.\nDecorative wrappers always need to be sprayed cause they will stick regardless. \nJust a side note on the applesauce comment. Yes, it was for sure the applesauce that will make them heavy.  Apple Sauce is a horrible substitute for oil! Sour cream or yogurt works great. Try that instead.\nIf your baked goods sink, simple problem.\nWasn't baked long enough.\nAs far as the choc. chips sinking. Add Half your flour mixture into the wet mixture. Then add the choc. Chips to the remaining flour mixture whisk together. Then add to the wet batter. No more sinking chips!\nHope these tips help!"", 'followingCount': 0}, 7926269: {'rating': 3, 'followersCount': 0, 'madeRecipesCount': 18, 'favoritesCount': 53, 'dateLastModified': u'2011-11-04T11:25:04.94', 'text': u""I made a few of the adjustments that other suggested.  I'm not sure how to describe how these came out...  Maybe tough?  Chewy?  The texture of them was odd, and I thought they were a little too sweet and a little too chocolatey for a muffin.  Next time I make them, I will not do the adjustments and see how they turn out.  My muffins also collapsed in the middle, I'm thinking I may have overmixed them.  To avoid that next time, I will mix the wet into the dry instead of the dry into the wet.  I find it easier to do without overmixing."", 'followingCount': 0}}
